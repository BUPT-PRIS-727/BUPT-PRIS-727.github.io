      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine fog poses a significant hazard to global shipping, necessitating effective detection and forecasting to reduce economic losses. In recent years, several machine learning (ML) methods have demonstrated superior detection accuracy compared to traditional meteorological methods. However, most of these works are developed on proprietary datasets, and the few publicly accessible datasets are often limited to simplistic toy scenarios for research purposes. To advance the field, we have collected nearly a decade’s worth of multi-modal data related to continuous marine fog stages from four series of geostationary meteorological satellites, along with meteorological observations and numerical analysis, covering 15 marine regions globally where maritime fog frequently occurs. Through pixel-level manual annotation by meteorological experts, we present the most comprehensive marine fog detection and forecasting dataset to date, named M4Fog, to bridge ocean and atmosphere. The dataset comprises 68,000 “super data cubes” along four dimensions: elements, latitude, longitude and time, with a temporal resolution of half an hour and a spatial resolution of 1 kilometer. Considering practical applications, we have defined and explored three meaningful tracks with multi-metric evaluation systems: static or dynamic marine fog detection, and spatio-temporal forecasting for cloud images. Extensive benchmarking and experiments demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the construction concept for proposed M4Fog. The data and codes are available to whole researchers through cloud platforms to develop ML-driven marine fog solutions and mitigate adverse impacts on human activities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weakly Supervised Sea Fog Detection in Remote Sensing Images via Prototype Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sea fog detection is a challenging and significant task in the field of remote sensing. Deep learning-based methods have shown promising potential, but require a large amount of pixel-level labeled data that are time-consuming and labor-intensive to acquire. To scale up the dataset and overcome the limitations of pixel-level annotation, we attempt to explore the existing knowledge from historical statistics for label-efficient sea fog detection. In this article, we propose an image-level weakly supervised sea fog detection dataset (WS-SFDD) and a novel weakly supervised sea fog detection framework via prototype learning, named ProCAM. According to the sea fog events recorded by the Marine Weather Review published quarterly by the National Meteorological Center of China, we collect the sea fog images from Himawari-8 satellite data and obtain free image-level labels to construct the dataset. However, with image-level annotations, the existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods mainly rely on class activation maps (CAMs) and have limitations when applied to such a specific scenario: 1) the pseudo-labels (PLs) mainly cover the most discriminative part of object regions that are incomplete; 2) the background is complex with varying atmospheric conditions, and it is difficult to distinguish sea fog from low clouds due to their high similarity in spectral characteristics; and 3) the co-occurring context, such as “sea,” distracts the model and thus degrades the performance. To address the above issues, in our proposed ProCAM, we first design a prototype reactivation (PRA) module that reactivates self-similar sea fog regions by pixel-to-prototype feature matching to improve the robustness and completeness of CAMs. Then, we develop a pixel-to-prototype contrastive (PPC) learning method to increase the distance between sea fog and background in the embedding space for learning more discriminative dense features. Finally, a self-augmented regularization (SAR) strategy is presented to decouple sea fog from its co-ocurring context, and thus avoid background interference. Extensive experiments on the WS-SFDD dataset demonstrate that our proposed method ProCAM achieves superior performance with an $F1$ score of 77.59% and a critical success index (CSI) of 63.39%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to perform image-level weakly supervised sea fog detection in remote sensing images. The dataset and code are available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yixianghuang/ProCAM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/yixianghuang/ProCAM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SeaMAE: Masked Pre-Training with Meteorological Satellite Imagery for Sea Fog Detection</title>
      <link>https://BUPT-PRIS-727.github.io/publications/seamae/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sea fog detection (SFD) presents a significant challenge in the field of intelligent Earth observation, particularly in analyzing meteorological satellite imagery. Akin to various vision tasks, ImageNet pre-training is commonly used for pre-training SFD. However, in the context of multi-spectral meteorological satellite imagery, the initial step of deep learning has received limited attention. Recently, pre-training with Very High-Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has gained increased popularity in remote-sensing vision tasks, showing the potential to replace ImageNet pre-training. However, it is worth noting that the meteorological satellite imagery applied in SFD, despite being an application of computer vision in remote sensing, differs greatly from VHR satellite imagery. To address the limitation of pre-training for SFD, this paper introduces a novel deep-learning paradigm to the meteorological domain driven by Masked Image Modeling (MIM). Our research reveals two key insights: (1) Pre-training with meteorological satellite imagery yields superior SFD performance compared to pre-training with nature imagery and VHR satellite imagery. (2) Incorporating the architectural characteristics of SFD models into a vanilla masked autoencoder (MAE) can augment the effectiveness of meteorological pre-training. To facilitate this research, we curate a pre-training dataset comprising 514,655 temporal multi-spectral meteorological satellite images, covering the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea regions, which have the most sea fog occurrence. The longitude ranges from 115.00E to 128.75E, and the latitude ranges from 27.60N to 41.35N. Moreover, we introduce SeaMAE, a novel MAE that utilizes a Vision Transformer as the encoder and a convolutional hierarchical decoder, to learn meteorological representations. SeaMAE is pre-trained on this dataset and fine-tuned for SFD, resulting in state-of-the-art performance. For instance, using the ViT-Base as the backbone, SeaMAE pre-training which achieves 64.18% surpasses from-scratch learning, natural imagery pre-training, and VRH satellite imagery pre-training by 5.53% , 2.49% , and 2.21% , respectively, in terms of Intersection over Union of SFD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weather2K: A Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Benchmark Dataset for Meteorological Forecasting Based on Real-Time Observation Data from Ground Weather Stations</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather forecasting is one of the cornerstones of meteorological work. In this paper, we present a new benchmark dataset named Weather2K, which aims to make up for the deficiencies of existing weather forecasting datasets in terms of real-time, reliability, and diversity, as well as the key bottleneck of data quality. To be specific, our Weather2K is featured from the following aspects: 1) Reliable and real-time data. The data is hourly collected from 2,130 ground weather stations covering an area of 6 million square kilometers. 2) Multivariate meteorological variables. 20 meteorological factors and 3 constants for position information are provided with a length of 40,896 time steps. 3) Applicable to diverse tasks. We conduct a set of baseline tests on time series forecasting and spatio-temporal forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, our Weather2K is the first attempt to tackle weather forecasting task by taking full advantage of the strengths of observation data from ground weather stations. Based on Weather2K, we further propose Meteorological Factors based Multi-Graph Convolution Network (MFMGCN), which can effectively construct the intrinsic correlation among geographic locations based on meteorological factors. Sufficient experiments show that MFMGCN improves both the forecasting performance and temporal robustness. We hope our Weather2K can significantly motivate researchers to develop efficient and accurate algorithms to advance the task of weather forecasting. The dataset can be available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bycnfz/weather2k/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/bycnfz/weather2k/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
