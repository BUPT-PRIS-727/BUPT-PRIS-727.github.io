      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine fog poses a significant hazard to global shipping, necessitating effective detection and forecasting to reduce economic losses. In recent years, several machine learning (ML) methods have demonstrated superior detection accuracy compared to traditional meteorological methods. However, most of these works are developed on proprietary datasets, and the few publicly accessible datasets are often limited to simplistic toy scenarios for research purposes. To advance the field, we have collected nearly a decade’s worth of multi-modal data related to continuous marine fog stages from four series of geostationary meteorological satellites, along with meteorological observations and numerical analysis, covering 15 marine regions globally where maritime fog frequently occurs. Through pixel-level manual annotation by meteorological experts, we present the most comprehensive marine fog detection and forecasting dataset to date, named M4Fog, to bridge ocean and atmosphere. The dataset comprises 68,000 “super data cubes” along four dimensions: elements, latitude, longitude and time, with a temporal resolution of half an hour and a spatial resolution of 1 kilometer. Considering practical applications, we have defined and explored three meaningful tracks with multi-metric evaluation systems: static or dynamic marine fog detection, and spatio-temporal forecasting for cloud images. Extensive benchmarking and experiments demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the construction concept for proposed M4Fog. The data and codes are available to whole researchers through cloud platforms to develop ML-driven marine fog solutions and mitigate adverse impacts on human activities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weather2K: A Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Benchmark Dataset for Meteorological Forecasting Based on Real-Time Observation Data from Ground Weather Stations</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather forecasting is one of the cornerstones of meteorological work. In this paper, we present a new benchmark dataset named Weather2K, which aims to make up for the deficiencies of existing weather forecasting datasets in terms of real-time, reliability, and diversity, as well as the key bottleneck of data quality. To be specific, our Weather2K is featured from the following aspects: 1) Reliable and real-time data. The data is hourly collected from 2,130 ground weather stations covering an area of 6 million square kilometers. 2) Multivariate meteorological variables. 20 meteorological factors and 3 constants for position information are provided with a length of 40,896 time steps. 3) Applicable to diverse tasks. We conduct a set of baseline tests on time series forecasting and spatio-temporal forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, our Weather2K is the first attempt to tackle weather forecasting task by taking full advantage of the strengths of observation data from ground weather stations. Based on Weather2K, we further propose Meteorological Factors based Multi-Graph Convolution Network (MFMGCN), which can effectively construct the intrinsic correlation among geographic locations based on meteorological factors. Sufficient experiments show that MFMGCN improves both the forecasting performance and temporal robustness. We hope our Weather2K can significantly motivate researchers to develop efficient and accurate algorithms to advance the task of weather forecasting. The dataset can be available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bycnfz/weather2k/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/bycnfz/weather2k/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
