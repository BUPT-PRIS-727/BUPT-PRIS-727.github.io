      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sea fog detection is a challenging and significant task in the field of remote sensing. Deep learning-based methods have shown promising potential, but require a large amount of pixel-level labeled data that are time-consuming and labor-intensive to acquire. To scale up the dataset and overcome the limitations of pixel-level annotation, we attempt to explore the existing knowledge from historical statistics for label-efficient sea fog detection. In this article, we propose an image-level weakly supervised sea fog detection dataset (WS-SFDD) and a novel weakly supervised sea fog detection framework via prototype learning, named ProCAM. According to the sea fog events recorded by the Marine Weather Review published quarterly by the National Meteorological Center of China, we collect the sea fog images from Himawari-8 satellite data and obtain free image-level labels to construct the dataset. However, with image-level annotations, the existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods mainly rely on class activation maps (CAMs) and have limitations when applied to such a specific scenario: 1) the pseudo-labels (PLs) mainly cover the most discriminative part of object regions that are incomplete; 2) the background is complex with varying atmospheric conditions, and it is difficult to distinguish sea fog from low clouds due to their high similarity in spectral characteristics; and 3) the co-occurring context, such as “sea,” distracts the model and thus degrades the performance. To address the above issues, in our proposed ProCAM, we first design a prototype reactivation (PRA) module that reactivates self-similar sea fog regions by pixel-to-prototype feature matching to improve the robustness and completeness of CAMs. Then, we develop a pixel-to-prototype contrastive (PPC) learning method to increase the distance between sea fog and background in the embedding space for learning more discriminative dense features. Finally, a self-augmented regularization (SAR) strategy is presented to decouple sea fog from its co-ocurring context, and thus avoid background interference. Extensive experiments on the WS-SFDD dataset demonstrate that our proposed method ProCAM achieves superior performance with an $F1$ score of 77.59% and a critical success index (CSI) of 63.39%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to perform image-level weakly supervised sea fog detection in remote sensing images. The dataset and code are available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yixianghuang/ProCAM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/yixianghuang/ProCAM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sea fog detection with remote sensing images is a challenging task. Driven by the different image characteristics between fog and other types of clouds, such as textures and colors, it can be achieved by using image processing methods. Currently, most of the available methods are data-driven and relying on manual annotations. However, because few meteorological observations and buoys over the sea can be realized, obtaining visibility information to help the annotations is difficult. Considering the feasibility of obtaining abundant visible information over the land and the similarity between land fog and sea fog, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method to bridge the abundant labeled land fog data and the unlabeled sea fog data to realize the sea fog detection. We used a seeded region growing module to obtain pixel-level masks from rough-labels generated by the unsupervised domain adaptation model. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of sea fog recognition up to 99.17%, which is nearly 3% higher than those vanilla methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Correlation Context-Driven Method for Sea Fog Detection in Meteorological Satellite Imagery</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sea fog detection is a challenging and essential issue in satellite remote sensing. Although conventional threshold methods and deep learning methods can achieve pixel-level classification, it is difficult to distinguish ambiguous boundaries and thin structures from the background. Considering the correlations between neighbor pixels and the affinities between superpixels, a correlation context-driven method for sea fog detection is proposed in this letter, which mainly consists of a two-stage superpixel-based fully convolutional network (SFCNet), named SFCNet. A fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) is utilized to model the dependencies between pixels. To alleviate the problem of high cloud occlusion, an attentive Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is implemented for image enhancement by exploiting contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves 91.65% mIoU and obtains more refined segmentation results, performing well in detecting fogs in small, broken bits and weak contrast thin structures, as well as detects more obscured parts.&lt;/p&gt;
